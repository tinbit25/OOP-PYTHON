# Inheritance


# ---

# ### **1. Basic Inheritance and Method Overriding**
# **Question**:  
# Define a base class named `Animal` with a method `speak()`. Create a derived class `Dog` that overrides the `speak()` method. How should the code be implemented?  

# **Solution**:  
# ```python
# class Animal:
#     def speak(self):
#         return "I make a sound."

# class Dog(Animal):
#     def speak(self):
#         return "Woof! Woof!"

# # Example usage
# animal = Animal()
# dog = Dog()

# print(animal.speak())  # Output: I make a sound.
# print(dog.speak())     # Output: Woof! Woof!
# ```

# ---

# ### **2. Extending Attributes in Derived Classes**
# **Question**:  
# Create a base class `Book` with attributes for `title` and `author`. Write a derived class `EBook` that adds an attribute for `file_size`. How would you extend the functionality of the `Book` class in the `EBook` class?  

# **Solution**:  
# ```python
# class Book:
#     def __init__(self, title, author):
#         self.title = title
#         self.author = author

# class EBook(Book):
#     def __init__(self, title, author, file_size):
#         super().__init__(title, author)
#         self.file_size = file_size

# # Example usage
# ebook = EBook("Python Basics", "John Doe", "2MB")
# print(f"{ebook.title} by {ebook.author}, File Size: {ebook.file_size}")
# # Output: Python Basics by John Doe, File Size: 2MB
# ```



# ### **4. Class Hierarchies with Unique Methods**
# **Question**:  
# Design a class hierarchy where `Animal` is the base class, and `Mammal` and `Bird` are derived classes. Each derived class should include a unique method that describes a distinctive feature.  

# **Solution**:  
# ```python
# class Animal:
#     def description(self):
#         return "I am an animal."

# class Mammal(Animal):
#     def nurse(self):
#         return "I nurse my young."

# class Bird(Animal):
#     def fly(self):
#         return "I can fly."

# # Example usage
# mammal = Mammal()
# bird = Bird()

# print(mammal.description())  # Output: I am an animal.
# print(mammal.nurse())        # Output: I nurse my young.
# print(bird.description())    # Output: I am an animal.
# print(bird.fly())            # Output: I can fly.
# ```

# ---

# ### **5. Calling Parent Class Methods from Derived Classes**
# **Question**:  
# How would you implement a method in the base class that is explicitly called from a derived class? Provide an example.  

# **Solution**:  
# ```python
# class Animal:
#     def __init__(self, name):
#         self.name = name

#     def description(self):
#         return f"I am an animal named {self.name}."

# class Dog(Animal):
#     def __init__(self, name, breed):
#         super().__init__(name)
#         self.breed = breed

#     def description(self):
#         parent_desc = super().description()
#         return f"{parent_desc} I am a {self.breed}."

# # Example usage
# dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
# print(dog.description())
# # Output: I am an animal named Buddy. I am a Golden Retriever.
# ```
